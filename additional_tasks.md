# Additional Tasks for HealthMate Unified Authentication and Dashboard Redesign

## 1. Unified Authentication ✅
- [x] Remove separate login/registration/forgot password forms from the Streamlit app UI.

- [x] Update backend endpoints if needed to support unified authentication.

## 2. Post-Login User Flow ✅

## 6. Testing and Validation ✅
- [x] Test unified login/registration/forgot password flow end-to-end.
- [x] Test access control: only authenticated users can access dashboard features.
- [x] Test chatbot, chat history, health metrics, health profile, reports, and settings for correct integration.
- [x] Test logout and session timeout behavior.

## 7. Documentation ✅
- [x] Update user and developer documentation to reflect the new unified authentication and dashboard flow.

## 8. Session State and App Architecture Fixes ✅
- [x] Fix session state initialization error in streamlit_app.py
- [x] Ensure AuthManager properly initializes session state before any authentication checks
- [x] Clarify that streamlit_app.py is the main HealthMate chatbot application, not a separate dashboard
- [x] Remove any remaining dashboard references from the authentication flow
- [x] Ensure the app shows only the chatbot interface after login, not a dashboard with multiple features
- [x] Update the app title and description to reflect it's a HealthMate chatbot
- [x] Test the fixed session state initialization
- [x] Verify the app works as a unified HealthMate chatbot application

## 9. Sidebar Navigation and App Integration ✅
- [x] Fix sidebar navigation to only show dashboard features after user login
- [x] Hide dashboard navigation items (chat history, health metrics, health profile, reports, settings) on authentication pages
- [x] Show only authentication-related navigation on login/register pages
- [x] Integrate streamlit_app.py as a chatbot feature within the main HealthMate app
- [x] Ensure streamlit_app.py is not a separate application but a component of the main HealthMate app
- [x] Update navigation flow to properly show/hide features based on authentication status
- [x] Test the conditional sidebar navigation
- [x] Verify the integrated app structure works correctly

## 10. Backend Connection and Port Configuration ✅
- [x] Fix backend connection error by updating port configuration
- [x] Update AuthManager to use correct backend port (8003)
- [x] Update unified_auth.py to use correct backend port (8003)
- [x] Update streamlit_app.py to use correct backend port (8003)
- [x] Test backend connectivity and authentication flow
- [x] Verify all API endpoints are accessible
- [x] Ensure frontend can successfully connect to backend
- [x] Test login/registration functionality with correct backend URL

## 11. Database Schema Fix ✅
- [x] Identify missing database columns (reset_token, reset_token_expires)
- [x] Add missing columns to users table manually
- [x] Verify database schema matches the User model
- [x] Test backend API endpoints after schema fix
- [x] Confirm authentication endpoints return proper JSON responses
- [x] Test user registration functionality
- [x] Ensure no more "Expecting value" JSON parsing errors
- [x] Verify complete authentication flow works end-to-end

## Notes for Cursor Agent
- Focus on creating reusable, modular components
- Maintain consistent styling and user experience across all pages
- Implement proper error handling and loading states
- Ensure all components are accessible and keyboard navigable
- Use semantic HTML and proper ARIA attributes
- Test components thoroughly before marking tasks complete
- Follow the existing project structure and coding standards
- Run unit test after each task is completed.
- **Important**: streamlit_app.py should be the main HealthMate chatbot application, not a dashboard with multiple features
- **Important**: Sidebar navigation should be conditional based on authentication status
