    'procedures': ['blood_test', 'x_ray', 'surgery', ...]
}
```

#### 3. Hybrid Search Implementation
```python
async def _hybrid_search(self, query: SearchQuery) -> List[SearchResult]:
    """Hybrid search combining vector and keyword search"""
    vector_results = await self._vector_search(query)
    keyword_results = await self._keyword_search(query)
    return self._combine_search_results(vector_results, keyword_results)
```

#### 4. Advanced Filtering System
```python
def _apply_filters(self, results: List[SearchResult], filters: Dict[str, Any]) -> List[SearchResult]:
    """Apply comprehensive filters to search results"""
    # Document type filtering
    # Credibility level filtering
    # Date range filtering
    # Source filtering
```
