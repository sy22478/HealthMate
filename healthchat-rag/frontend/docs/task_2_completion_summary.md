- **Logout functionality** accessible from the sidebar
- **Seamless page transitions** between different dashboard sections

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified/Created

#### Frontend Changes
- `frontend/pages/unified_auth.py` - Enhanced with automatic redirect and better UX
- `frontend/streamlit_app.py` - Updated to serve as main dashboard with navigation
- `frontend/docs/task_2_completion_summary.md` - This documentation

#### Testing
- `tests/test_post_login_flow.py` - New test suite for post-login functionality
- `tests/test_end_to_end_flow.py` - Comprehensive end-to-end testing

### Key Code Changes

#### Automatic Redirect Implementation
```python
# Auto-redirect to main dashboard after successful login
st.success("Login successful! Redirecting to dashboard...")
st.balloons()
# Use JavaScript to redirect after a short delay
st.markdown("""
<script>
    setTimeout(function() {
        window.location.href = '../streamlit_app.py';
    }, 2000);
</script>
""", unsafe_allow_html=True)
```

#### Enhanced Dashboard Access Control
```python
# Check authentication
if not st.session_state.authenticated or not st.session_state.token:
    st.error("üîê Authentication Required")
    # Redirect to login page
    st.stop()
```

#### Quick Actions Feature
```python
# Quick action buttons for common health queries
st.markdown("### Quick Actions")
col1, col2, col3 = st.columns(3)
with col1:
    if st.button("üè• Health Check", use_container_width=True):
        st.session_state.quick_action = "health_check"
```
